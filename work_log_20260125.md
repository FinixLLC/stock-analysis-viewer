## Summary

Added "Today's Top Picks" feature to GitHub Pages dashboard with plain text descriptions for top-performing stocks.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. GitHub Pages - Today's Top Picks Section

**File Modified:** `src/stock-analysis-pages/index.html`

**Features Added:**
- New "Today's Top Picks" section displaying top 3 Tier 1-2 stocks
- Plain text descriptions explaining each stock's metrics
- Color-coded tier badges (Tier 1 = green, Tier 2 = blue, Tier 3 = yellow)
- Metrics bar showing Price, Pattern, Momentum, Volume, Exchange

**Description Format:**
Each stock pick includes a generated description covering:
- Pattern type (Cup and Handle, V-Bottom, Spoon)
- Detection date
- Momentum assessment (exceptional/strong/solid/moderate based on score)
- Volume description (above-average/healthy/moderate)
- Volatility assessment (favorable/manageable/higher)
- Risk factors (minimal/low/some to monitor)
- Overall tier justification

**Example Output:**
> **ZEUS** on NASDAQ shows a Cup and Handle formation detected on 2026-01-20. The stock demonstrates strong momentum (70) with healthy trading volume (62). Technical analysis indicates favorable low volatility (85) and minimal risk factors (5.8). Overall composite score of 82.8 places this in Tier 2.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Fetches `file-list.json` to find most recent CSV files
- Parses CSV data to extract top stocks from NASDAQ and NYSE
- Filters for Tier 1-2 stocks (falls back to top 3 by score if none)
- Generates human-readable descriptions dynamically
